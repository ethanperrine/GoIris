## is an open-source project for local password recovery supporting the following hash types 
* MD4
* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA256
* SHA512
* Potentially more in the future!

## TODO:
* Implement TUI || GUI for improved user experience
* Implement a config system to choose what hash types users want.
* Possibly different types of local storage options? e.g., LevelDB, UnQLite, extremeDB, etc...
* Improve compatibility across different types of operating systems.
